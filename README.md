# gomat
A simple matrix/2D array library in Go. Inspired by gonum but I needed complex numbers. 
I implemented in pure Go with the matrices generic on the data type they hold. This
let me use complex numbers or floats. They are stored row wise and you can iterate
through rows with the `range` construct in a loop.
